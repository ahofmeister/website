Sometimes it is required to just drop all tables of a specific schema in PostgreSQL.
In order to delete the whole schema, execute the below command in the SQL query console.

```sql
DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA public;
```
This helps to delete tables that are, for instance, not deleted during an auto creation of the schema using Hibernate.
